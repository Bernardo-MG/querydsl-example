## Features

- Querydsl with JPA and Hibernate
- Querydsl with Mongodb

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [the latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [the latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site sources come along the source code (as it is a Maven site), so it is always possible to generate them using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site -P h2
```

The verify phase is required, as otherwise some of the reports won't be created.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

### Profiles

Maven profiles are included for setting up the database and JPA provider.

| Profile  | Database                  |
|----------|---------------------------|
| h2       | H2 in-memory database     |
| hsqldb   | HSQLDB in-memory database |
| mysql    | MySQL database            |
| postgres | PostgreSQL database       |

### Running the tests

The project requires a database and a JPA provider for being able to run the integration tests:

```
mvn verify -P h2
```

### Missing JPA metadata

Currently there are some problems when generating the JPA metadata classes automatically. Mainly that they are not generated when trying to refresh the Maven project on Eclipse.

To fix this just package the project:

```
mvn package
```

## Collaborate
